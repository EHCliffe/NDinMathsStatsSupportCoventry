# Plan

-   Some experience students might have
-   Some approaches I've used

# Some experiences students might have

## Joe, an engineer

> "I'm having real problems with maths, the other modules have good workbooks"

* Verbal comprehension: superior
* Perceptual reasoning: high average
* Working memory: low average (significantly weak)
* Processing speed: average range (relatively weak)
* Word recognition: below average (significantly weak)
* Writing speed: well below average (significantly weak)
* Writing untidy and difficult to read

## Mary, a mathematician

> "I feel so stupid, maths is what I have always been good at and now I can't understand any of it."

* Verbal comprehension: superior
* Perceptual reasoning: high average
* Working memory: superior
* Processing speed: average range (relatively weak)
* Word recognition: average range (significantly weak)
* Writing speed: average range (relatively weak)
* Writing generally legible and coherent 

## Ali, a chemist

> "I have a student I don't know how to help ... this involves seeing molecules in 3D and determining their symmetry. She finds this particularly difficult and although we made some progress, she became rather distressed through frustration"

* Working memory and processing speed commensurate with her verbal comprehension and perceptual processing skills
* No reading difficulties
* Significantly weak fine motor control
* Difficulties with co-ordination and spatial awareness

## Nat, a sports scientist

> "She is having significant problems with her maths module".

Dyscalculia screener suggested difficulties with:

* Comparing relative sizes of numbers (word, symbol and visual-spatial)
* Concepts and inferences about operations on numbers or relationships between them
* Understanding time 

# Some approaches I've used

## In the moment

* Multisensory approach with consistent colour and images
* Consistently link symbol, word and process
* Break problems down into small, manageable steps
* Read maths aloud, 'think' aloud yourself
* Encourage thinking aloud, act as a scribe if needed
* Use visualisations, concrete examples and concrete objects
* Use flow charts connected to a concrete example
* Use concept maps to highlight relationships and connections between the abstract and the concrete

## In the moment cont.

* Encourage student to use multisensory approaches
* Encourage overlearning e.g. index cards, electronic tests
* Encourage metacognition, reflection on problem solving
* Bring working memory overload to the student's awareness
* Find approaches which reduce working memory load
* Block out information not in use, break up large sections of text, ensure student can change font, colour, have content read aloud if it helps
* Experiment with different ways to capture thought process and to write up work

## Building strategies

* Notetaking for mathematics, structured annotation
* Using expanding symbol range and vocabulary
* Building rich accurate concept images, example use
* Connecting and mapping concepts, visualisation
* Active reading for mathematics, self-explanation
* Problem classification, structured problem solving
* Developing an internal monitor, raising metacognition
* Build approaches for processes e.g. diagrams, overlearning
* Mathematical writing skills, as appropriate to level...
